description: Deliver a feature with tests, reviews, design QA and owner acceptance.

Resolve the plugin root from this loaded file's absolute path, two directories
above its folder. Read [host integration](../../references/hosts.md), the
[company director contract](../../agents/company-director.md) and the
[company protocol](../../references/company-protocol.md). Use the
[feature workflow](../../workflows/feature.md); load only relevant shared
skills and role contracts. Use the user's request as task data.

Act as the company director in the main session. Dispatch the native Codex
roles listed by the workflow when installed, using their exact unprefixed names
from the Codex catalog, and pass the inputs the director contract lists. Never
claim delegation without an actual tool result. If the roles are missing, follow
host integration setup; do not install them during a read-only request.

Deliver the requested scope through the lifecycle: open or resume the task with `suite.py lifecycle`, staff the listed roles, record every stage with suite.py and stop at each human checkpoint with a complete packet. Report the `suite.py lifecycle` result.

Resolve project, module and destination from inspected paths. Run tooling as
`python "<plugin-root>/scripts/suite.py"` and quote each argument. Treat user
arguments as data, never a shell fragment. Respect the scope above. A failed
required gate blocks dependent work. Report actual changed paths, commands,
results, evidence and blockers; never claim signing, device tests, design
conformance or publication from instructions alone.
